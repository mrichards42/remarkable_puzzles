Galaxies

Draw lines along grid edges so as to divide the grid up into connected regions of squares.

Every region should have two-way rotational symmetry, should contain exactly one dot which is in its centre, and should contain no lines separating two of its own squares from each other. A region satisfying all of these requirements will be automatically highlighted.

Click on a grid edge to add or remove a line. Click on a dot and drag to place an arrow in a grid square pointing to that dot, to indicate that you think that square must belong in the same region as that dot. Click and drag an existing arrow to move it, or drop it off the edge of the grid to remove it.
